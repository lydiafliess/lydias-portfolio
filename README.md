# lydias-portfolio

## Description

- For this project I wanted to showcase what I've learned and some of the applications I've created so far.
- I wanted to create a website that shows employers why I would be a good fit for their open position. I wanted to utilize the skills I've learned in html and specifically css. I also wanted to create a website that I can build off of and improve as I advance in the bootcamp.
- This portfolio was also a learning experience and allowed me to get a better grasp on css layout and html structure.
